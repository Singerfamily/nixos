# Nix Agent

## Overview

Use this skill for straightforward NixOS execution tasks through `nix-agent` and `mcp-nixos`. Core principle: use `mcp-nixos` for discovery, use `nix-agent` for local mutation and activation, and do not detour into generic design workflows unless the user is explicitly asking for architecture.

## When to Use

- A user asks to install a package on NixOS.
- A user asks which option or module setting to use, then wants it applied.
- A user asks to patch local NixOS config through MCP tools.
- The host exposes both `nix-agent` and `mcp-nixos` and the task is operational, not architectural.
- A generic brainstorming or planning skill would slow down an otherwise direct NixOS MCP workflow.

Do not use this skill for imperative package installs, writing secret payloads, or broad architecture/design requests.

## Priority Rule

For direct NixOS MCP execution tasks, this skill takes precedence over generic brainstorming or planning workflows.

If the user says things like:
- `install X on NixOS`
- `enable this option`
- `patch my NixOS config`
- `use mcp-nixos and nix-agent together`

then execute the `mcp-nixos` + `nix-agent` workflow directly.

Do **not** start a generic brainstorming flow first unless the user is asking for architecture, design trade-offs, or multi-approach planning.

## Quick Reference

- `mcp-nixos` for package and option discovery
- `plan_change(goal)` before mutation
- `apply_patch_set(patch_set)`
- `run_formatters(changed_files)`
- `classify_change(changed_files)`
- `apply_change(intent, changed_files, flake_uri)` if allowed

## Required Workflow

1. If the request needs package or option discovery, query `mcp-nixos` first.
2. Call `plan_change(goal)`.
3. If `requires_mcp_nixos=true`, stop local mutation and use `mcp-nixos` before continuing.
4. Build a `PatchSet` and call `apply_patch_set(patch_set)`.
5. If `apply_patch_set()` returns `status="approval_required"`, stop and report that approval is needed.
6. Run `run_formatters(changed_files)`.
7. Run `classify_change(changed_files)`.
8. If `approval_required` is `true`, stop and report the reason.
9. Only then call `apply_change(intent, changed_files, flake_uri)`.

## Common Mistakes

- Starting a generic brainstorming/design workflow for a simple package install.
- Skipping `mcp-nixos` and guessing package names or option paths.
- Skipping `plan_change()`.
- Calling `apply_change()` right after patching without `run_formatters()`.
- Ignoring `approval_required`.
- Assuming `nix-agent` should do package discovery itself.
- Writing secret material through patches.

## Red Flags

- `I should brainstorm first`
- `I need a design before installing this package`
- `I should explore the whole repo before calling the MCPs`
- `I can probably guess the NixOS option without mcp-nixos`

All of these mean: return to the `mcp-nixos` + `nix-agent` workflow.

## Example

User asks: `Use mcp-nixos and nix-agent together to install floorp on my NixOS system.`

1. Query `mcp-nixos` for the correct Floorp package attribute.
2. Call `plan_change("install floorp on NixOS")`.
3. Patch the relevant NixOS file with `apply_patch_set(...)`.
4. Run `run_formatters(changed_files)`.
5. Run `classify_change(changed_files)`.
6. If allowed, call `apply_change("install floorp", changed_files, flake_uri)`.
7. Report the changed file and each tool result.
